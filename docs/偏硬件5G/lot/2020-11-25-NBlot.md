Visual CertExam Suite 
Import wizard
The Import Wizard automatically creates exam files from existing text files (e.g., .txt, .rtf) containing exam items. For this purpose, you should format a source file using the agreements described below. Additionally, the Import Wizard allows you to import questions, testlets, questions sets and complete exams from other .vce files.

Source file format
The source file containing questions can be either a usual text file or a formatted text document in RTF (Rich Text Format). Irrespective of the format, the file should consist of the following parts:

An exam description located before the first question (optionally). 
A numbered list of questions. 
Each question should consist of four parts:

Question text. 
List of answer choices. 
Correct answer. 
Explanation of a correct answer and references. 
The example of a source text file for import is given below and its format is described in details.

Source File Sample

1. Text of the first question.

A. First choice text.
B. Second choice text.
C. Third choice text.
D. Fourth choice text.

Answer: A

Correct answer explanation and reference.

2. Text of the second question.

a) First choice text.
b) Second choice text.
c) Third choice text.
d) Fourth choice text.

Answer: C and D

Correct answer explanation and reference.  

The source file should be formatted with use of the following rules:

Text located before the first question will be imported as the exam file description.


Questions are numbered consistently. Maximum question number is 999. There are three ways of question numbering: 


Number with a dot.
For example: "1.", "5.", "10.". 


Q-prefixed number with a dot.
For example: "Q1.", "Q2.", "Q105.". 


Q-prefixed number without a dot on a separate line (separated by a �return�).
For example: "Q3", "Q8", "Q87".
"Q3",
"Q8",
"Q87" 

On the fourth step of the Import Wizard you can specify the way in which questions are numbered in your source file. 


Question numbers should not necessarily begin with 1, but should follow one after another without misses and recurrences. 


Answer choices are designated by letters from A to Z with a dot or a right round bracket.
For example: "A.", "b.", "c)", "E)".


A correct answer should be on a separate line as the sequence of letters specifying correct answer choices, after a keyword "Answer" or "Ans" with a colon. 
For example: "Answer: A", "ANSWER:CD", "Ans: C, D", "ans : c, e and f".


Each question can have one or more correct answer choices. 


Text located after the correct answer and prior to the beginning of the next question, is imported as the explanation of the correct answer.


The same formatting rules are used for RTF-documents. Advantages of using RTF-documents consist in an opportunity to import the formatted text. But in view of Visual CertExam Designer features, there are some restrictions on the import of RTF-documents, which are necessary to take into account:

Current version of Visual CertExam Designer doesn't support work with tables, therefore the tables contained in the RTF-document will be ignored during the import. 


Only style and font of the text are imported, and the format of paragraphs is not taken into account. 


For the text written by Courier New font, Monospased Font will be used. For the text written in other fonts, Ordinary Font will be used. 


The original size of text is not taken into account and will be set to Normal.

Import Wizard Step 2 
Step 3. Specify the path and name of the source file.

Import Wizard Step 4 
Step 4. Question numbers in the source file are used as question delimiters during the import. On this step you should choose a way of question numbering. Each of these ways is explained in the description of the source file format. 

Besides, on this step you can reset the "Parse text located above the first question as the exam file description" checkbox, if you don't want to import the exam description.

Import Wizard Step 5 
Step 5. Import preview allows you to make sure of the correctness of the selected parameters. Go through the list of items to view the question text. If the source file is correctly divided into questions, you can begin the import.

Import Wizard Step 6 
Step 6. If you accept all the settings, click Import. After that, the Import Wizard will create a new exam file (or a new exam will be created in the existing exam file) and will automatically be filled it with the questions from the source file.
